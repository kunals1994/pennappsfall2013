Cartographr, our hack from Pennapps Fall 2013. 

Cartographr is a digital personal assistant. After users sign up, they receive sms notifications for events in their Google Calendar.  


We have a demo up <a href = "http://cartographr.kshar.me">here</a>. In the demo, the user will only receive a notification for the next event they have. 

The demo folder contains the code for this demo; the pennapps folder contains the code we wrote at Pennapps.
